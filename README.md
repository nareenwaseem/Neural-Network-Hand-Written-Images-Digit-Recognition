# Neural-Network-Hand-Written-Images-Digit-Recognition

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a neural network designed to recognize hand-written digits from 0 to 9. The model is built using Python and popular deep learning libraries, such as TensorFlow, to efficiently process and classify the digit images. The notebook includes step-by-step explanations, code snippets, and interactive visualizations to demonstrate the training process, model evaluation, and predictions. By using a neural network, the system achieves high accuracy in recognizing hand-written digits, making it a valuable tool for applications like digit recognition in OCR systems, automatic postal code sorting, and more. Users can easily experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and data augmentation techniques to further improve the model's performance. This project aims to provide an accessible and educational resource for those interested in deep learning, image classification, and pattern recognition using neural networks. Contributions from the community to enhance the model's capabilities and extend its applications are welcome through pull requests on GitHub.
